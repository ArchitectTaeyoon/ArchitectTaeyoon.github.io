            <p>Introducing a whole new system of market into the dense market neighborhood of Dongdae-mun in Seoul.</p>
            <h1>New Bicycle stands for the Han river</h1>
      	    <p>In this project I am proposing a new public bicycle rental system for the Han river, in order
            to resolve the current issue; many of the rentals are located in an inconvenient spots and are
            underused. To enhance visual exposure, convenience and general experience, I proposed new
            locations, where the rental spots would be more widely, and frequently placed at closer locations
            along the Han river public park.</p>
