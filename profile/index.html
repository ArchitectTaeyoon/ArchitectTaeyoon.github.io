    <h2>PROFILE
      </h2>
        <p>
        I am an architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have previously studied
        architecture for 4 years at Hongik University in Seoul, Korea. I have been on a Dual Degree Program
        since 2015 Fall - I will be receiving Bachelor's degree from both schools. Hence I am a Fifth year
        student at Hongik University, and a third year studio student at IIT. My main interest is in the
        realm of Digital Architecture, and my dream is to accomplish a new world of Architecture that will
        embrace human beings rather than stand as solid objects.
