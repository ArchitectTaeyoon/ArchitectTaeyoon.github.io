            <h2>PROFILE
            </h2>
            	<p>I am an architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have previously studied
              architecture for 4 years at Hongik University in Seoul, Korea. I have been on a Dual Degree Program
              since 2015 Fall - I will be receiving Bachelor's degree from both schools. Hence I am a Fifth year
              student at Hongik University, and a third year studio student at IIT. My main interest is in the realm of
              Digital Architecture, and my dream is to accomplish a new world of Architecture that will embrace human beings
              rather than stand as solid objects.
